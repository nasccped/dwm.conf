## What's DWM?

[DWM](https://dwm.suckless.org/) is a dynamic window manager for X.
It can managed windows in different ways such as **monocle**,
**tiled** and **floating**.

It works the almost the same as
[BSPWM](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm),
[FVWM](https://www.fvwm.org/) and others but I like this one because
of its simplicity and no RAM _eating_.

## Let's install it

### Requirements

DWM is built under the Xorg programs, so you'll need its libraries
and commands:

- libx11
- libxft
- libxinerama
- xorg
- xorg-xinit

I'm currently using the [`Fixedsys Excelsior`](https://github.com/kika/fixedsys)
font, so you'll may need it too. _(else, the dwm font will fallback
until find some available one - default case: `monospace`)_

> You can install all this stuff by using your package manager.
> Unfortunately, stable distros can suffer from outdated packages
> (I'm currently using Arch ~btw~). If it's your case, you'll
> probably need to handle a secundary package manager or build some
> _ deps._ from source ðŸ˜ž
>
> ---
>
> It's obvious but you'll also need the C compiler (`gcc`) and the
> make compiler tool (`make`)!
>
> ---
>
> I'm using:
> - `st - Suckless Terminal` _(`Shift` + `ModKey` + `Return`)_
> - `dmenu` _(`ModKey` + `P`)_
>
> It's recommended that you also have (or at least some good
> substitute such as `alacritty` and `rofi` - **YOU'LL NEED TO CHANGE
> THE `config.h` file to set the new apps**).

### Cloning

1. Clone with git + `cd` + remove git directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nasccped/dwm.conf && \
cd dwm.conf && \
rm -rf .git/
```

2. Install the dependencies listed at [requirements](#requirements)

3. Use the `Makefile` + `gcc` to compile the program:

```sh
make clean && sudo make install # you should be a super user + set your password
```

4. Add this to your `.xinitrc` (if it doesn't exists, create one):

```sh
exec dwm
```

And now, you can run `startx` at your TTY and see the actual program!

### Some good tips

#### Display

This can differ from computer to computer, so, follow these steps
wisely:

1. Open your dwm client (it's import to have a terminal emulator
   already setted):
```sh
startx
```

2. Open your terminal emulator (`Shift` + `ModKey` + `Return` by
   default) and run the following command to see all available
   display outputs:
```sh
xrandr
```

3. Find the mode that works for you (`1920x1080` res. + `60Hz` rate
   in my case)

4. Set xrandr mode in `.xinitrc` before calling `dwm`:

```sh
# the --output flag should receive the current screen being displayed
# (it can differ from computer to computer)
xrandr --output Virtual-1 --mode 1920x1080 --rate 60
```

#### Keyboard layout

The keyboard layout defined at Xorg client is different from the TTY
layout. You'll need to set your keyboard-layout to Xorg client in
`.xinitrc` too (`br-abnt2` in my case):

```sh
stxkbmap -layout br -variant abnt2
```

> [!TIP]

> If you don't know yours, you can google it (it's common to all
> computers from the same country follow the same keyboard layout) ðŸ˜‰

#### Dmenu font

Instead of define dmenu font in dwm source, I prefered to set it in
dmenu source due to workflow/update reasons. If you prefer setting
dmenu font in dwm source, just change these lines in `config.def.h`:

```c
/* ~12: */ static const char dmenufont[] = /* Set your prefered font here... */;

/*
 * ...
 */

// remove the comment within the char array
/* ~63: */ static const char *dmenucmd[] = { "dmenu_run", "-m", dmenumon, /* remove font set: "-fn", dmenufont, */ "-nb", col_gray1, "-nf", col_gray3, "-sb", col_cyan, "-sf", col_gray4, NULL };
```

## Changes that I've made

- use `Win` as **ModKey**
- use `alwayscenter` patch (center windows when floating)
- use `splitstatus` for status root name spliting (mid + right). My
  personal rootname config (in `.xinitrc`) is:
```sh
get_time() {
  date "+%H:%M"
}

get_weekname() {
  date "+%A"
}

get_date() {
  date "+%b %d, %Y"
}

get_battery() {
  local power_capacity=$(cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT*/capacity)
  local power_status=$(cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT*/status)
  echo "bat: $power_capacity% ($power_status)"
}

get_disk() {
	read -r _ _ used total _ _ <<< $(df -h | grep -w "/")
	echo "disk: $used/$total"
}

get_mem() {
  read -r _ total used _ _ _ <<< $(free -h | grep Mem)
  echo "mem: $used/$total"
}

while xsetroot -name "$(get_time); $(get_disk) | $(get_mem) | $(get_battery) | $(get_weekname) | $(get_date) "
do
  sleep 5
done &
exec dwm
```

- use `bar height` for changing, well, the bar height (you can
  reset it by defining `user_bh` as `0` in `config.def.h`)
- use `onlyquitonpempty` patch to avoid accidental closures
- use `fulltagindicator` patch instead of `activetagindicatorbar`
